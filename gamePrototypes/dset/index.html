        Be sure to...</p>
    <ul>
        <li>…bring a laptop! </li>
        <li>…make sure you have a web server installed that can serve local files on your machine.
            <br>Your computer may have this already. Check out the
            <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZuobsSmuaZwe8b0v3ZjeDjpTG5YRIiv4qpN6-U5eJuM" target="_blank">Getting
                Started</a> document.
        </li>
        <li>
            …download the starter files (the <code>dset</code> folder) to your server's root directory.
            <br>You will find a set of these files <a
                href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B7REdgmgslRzWTZhWkZZMHV2TWs" target="_blank">here</a>.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Session 1: Thursday 9:00–10:15</h2>
    <p>
        In this session, you'll program a CODAP plugin—an estimation game—in JavaScript, or possibly NetLogo.
        <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fe_mh3RV6TwVTaPVv5KsYlYj1LEgkp-hgKR2klLMd2Y" target="_blank">Click
            here</a> for instructions.
    </p>
    <p>For the "vanilla" Mac situation, if everything is installed properly, you can run it with this URL:<br>
        <a href="http://codap.concord.org/releases/dsg?di=http://localhost/dset/estim8/estim8.html" target="_blank">
            <code>http://codap.concord.org/releases/dsg?di=http://localhost/dset/estim8/estim8.html</code>
        </a>
    </p>
    <p>If you have changed your server or are not on a Mac, alter the above URL to point to the <code>dset</code> folder.</p>
    <h2>Session 2: Thursday 1:45–3:00</h2>
    <p>
        In this session, you'll teach your plugin to repond to CODAP events such as case selection.
