<h1>Strategy Hints</h1>

<p>The problem in this game is that if you get exposed to too much radiation,
    you lose. So you need some combination of:
<ul>
    <li>Getting less exposure with each measurement.
    <li>Taking fewer measurements.

</ul>
<p>So think about these issues. For example, ask,

<p>Why do you get more exposure sometimes and less at others?
    How could you use fewer measurements to figure out where the source is?

<p>Most people find the first question easier.

<p>Other things to consider:
<ul>
    <li>What other kinds of graphs can you make?

</ul>
