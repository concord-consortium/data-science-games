<h1>The Game</h1>

<p>A tiny amount of a dangerous radioactive substance was dropped somewhere
    in the dark gray-green region in the middle of your lab.

<p>Position your radiation detector
    (it shows up as a diamond in the field) by
    (a) clicking or (b) typing values into the coordinate boxes.

<p>Click the measure/collect button. When you do,
<ul>
    <li>If you are close enough to the source, you collect it and win.</li>
    <li>Otherwise, you learn the strength of the radiation there (in counts) and accumulate exposure ("Dose").</li>

</ul>
<p>CODAP records the x and y coordinates of your measurements as well as the counts.

<p>Use data to help you figure out where the speck is.
