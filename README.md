# data-science-games
Games and Simulations for the Data Science Games (DSG) project. Written in JavaScript, used in CODAP.

The purpose of the project is to explore and support the nascent field of Data Sceince Education, 
particularly as it might appear at the high-school level.

Note: All of these materials are still under development, so are not officially "released." 
We hope they will eventually turn into classroom-ready materials, but as of Summer 2017, that's still a ways away!

The project has been evolving away from being a "games" project to include more simulations and sandboxes.
